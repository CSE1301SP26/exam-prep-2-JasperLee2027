	For this problem we wish to construct a method named sumEvens that 
	will compute and return the sum of all even integer values in a 
	given array. For example, if you were given an array:

		int [] a = {3 , 4 , 6 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 9}

	The call to sumEvens(a) would return 16, the sum of all even 
	values in the array. You should assume that the array given 
	as an input could be any size, and your method should work
	appropriately. It is not necessary to use recursion for this 
	problem. Complete the method below:

	 */
	public static int sumEvens(int[] a) {
		//my code
		int sum = 0;
		for (int i=0; i<a.length;i++){
			if (a[i]%2=0) {
				sum= sum + a[i];
			}
		return sum;
	}

	public static void main ( String[] args ) {
		int [] a = {3 , 4 , 6 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 9};
		System.out.println(sumEvens(a)); //should be 16
	}

}
